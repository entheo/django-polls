# Help

 I don't know why it failed to find the templates after being installed to my another application called mysite successfully.

 Could you try to copy the code of django-polls and install it to  mysite in your local environment?
 And give me the feedback whethere you can succeed or not.

 Get my django-polls code : https://github.com/entheo/mysite
